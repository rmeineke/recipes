<h1>
Veal Chops w/ Basil-Parmesan Crust
</h1>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li class="bold">
Sauce: 
 </li>
 <li>
5 unpeeled garlic cloves 
    </li>
    <li>
1 tablespoon olive oil 
    </li>
    <li>
1 cup pine nuts, lightly toasted 
      </li>
      <li>
1/3 cup chopped shallot 
    </li>
    <li>
1 cup dry white wine 
     </li>
     <li>   
2 cups heavy cream
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li class="bold">
Crust: 
 </li>
 <li>
1/2 cup butter, softened 
    </li>
    <li>
1/4 pound ground veal 
    </li>
    <li>
2 large egg yolks 
    </li>
    <li>
2 cups packed fresh basil leaves, rinsed and spun dry 
          </li>
          <li>
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan 
     </li>
     <li>
1 tablespoon coarse-grained mustard 
    </li>
    <li>
1 teaspoon salt 
   </li>
   <li>
1/2 teaspoon white pepper
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>
1/2 cup olive oil 
    </li>
    <li>
6 - 12 ounce loin veal chops 
       </li>
       <li>
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<p>
Make the sauce:
Preheat oven to 350&deg;.  On a sheet of foil
drizzle the garlic with the oil, wrap the garlic in the foil, and roast
in the oven for 15 minutes or until soft to the touch.  Peel the
garlic, in a bowl with the back of a fork crush it to a puree, adding
1 teaspoon water if necessary.  Set garlic aside.
</p>
<p>
Chop half the pine nuts coarsely.  Reserve the chopped nuts and the
whole nuts separately.  In a dry 3-quart saucepan, heat the shallot
over moderately high heat until the shallot sizzles, add the wine and the
chopped pine nuts and boil the liquid until it barely covers the
pine nuts.  Add the cream and simmer the sauce, whisking, until
it is thickened.  Strain the sauce into a small saucepan, pressing
hard on the solids, stir in the garlic puree and salt and pepper to
taste.  Keep the sauce warm.
</p>

Make the crust:</span>

In a food processor blend together the butter, the
ground veal, the egg yolks, the basil, the Parmesan, the mustard,
the salt, and the pepper, pulsing the motor, until the mixture is smooth.
Transfer the crust mixture to a bowl and chill it, covered.
</p>
<p>
Preheat oven to 400&deg;.  In a large heavy skillet heat the 1/2 cup
oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking and brown
the chops, patted dry and seasoned with salt and pepper.
</p>
<p>
Transfer the chops with tongs to a broiler pan and coat 1 side of each
chop with about 1/3 cup of the crust mixture, smoothing the top.
Sprinkle the bread crumbs evenly on the crust mixture and roast the chops
in the middle of the oven for 12 - 15 minutes for medium-rare meat.
</p>
<p>
If desired, brown the chops under a preheated broiler for 1 - 2 minutes
or until the crust is golden.  Transfer the chops to plates, stir the
reserved whole pine nuts into the sauce and spoon the sauce around
the chops.
</p>
<p>
Serves 6.
