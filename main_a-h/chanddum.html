                 <li>
6 shallots, sliced thin (about 1 cup) 
       </li>
       <li>

       </li>
       <li>

      </li>
      <li>
1 small bay leaf 
    </li>
    <li>
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, crumbled 
     </li>
     <li>
3 1/2 cups low-salt chicken broth 
      </li>
      <li>
1/2 cup apple cider or juice
</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li class="bold">

For dumplings: 
  </li>
  <li>
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
     </li>
     <li>
1/2 cup yellow cornmeal 
    </li>
    <li>
1 tablespoon baking powder 
    </li>
    <li>
1/2 teaspoon salt 
   </li>
   <li>
2 tablespoons minced fresh dill 
     </li>
     <li>
1 cup plus 3 tablespoons half-and-half
</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>
1 cup green peas, defrosted if frozen
</li>
</ul>



<h2>Directions</h2>

<p>


Dredge chicken in seasoned flour, shaking off excess, and put
on a rack.
</p>
<p>
In a large heavy kettle melt butter with oil over moderately
high heat until foam subsides and brown chicken in batches
(do not crowd), transferring it to a plate as done, about 5 minutes
on each side.
</p>
<p>
Stir in leeks and shallots and cook 3 minutes, scraping the bottom
and stirring occasionally.  Stir in carrots, celery, bay leaf and
thyme and cook 3 minutes.  Stir in broth, cider, and chicken and
bring liquid to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer, covered partially,
until chicken is cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Make dumplings while chicken is cooking:
Into a bowl
sift together flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt and
stir in dill.  With a fork stir in half-and-half until
dough is just blended.
</p>
<p>
With a large soup spoon scoop out 12 dumplings and arrange
over chicken mixture.  Simmer chicken and dumplings, covered,
9 minutes.  Sprinkle in peas and cook until dumplings are done,
about 3 minutes more.  (Dumplngs are done when a wooden pick
inserted in center comes out clean.)  Discard bay leaf.
