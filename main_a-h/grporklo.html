<h1>
Grilled Pork Loin w/ Kentucky Bourbon Sauce
</h1>






<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>



1 boneless pork loin roast (about 3 pounds), fat trimmed
to 1/8", tied. 
   </li>
   <li>
2 teaspoons ground allspice or cinnamon 
      </li>
      <li>
2-3 medium size red onions, peeled and roots trimmed 
         </li>
         <li>
2-3 medium size white or yellow onions, peeled and roots
trimmed 
 </li>
 <li>
3-4 tablespoons apple jelly, preferably reduced sugar 
       </li>
       <li>
4-6 teaspoons margarine or butter 
     </li>
     <li>
2-3 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme leaves or 1/2 to 3/4
teaspoons dried. 
  </li>
  <li>
Kentucky Bourbon Sauce (Recipe is separate)
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<p>
1.  Rub outside of pork with allspice and generous
sprinkling of pepper.  Let stand at room temperature
30 minutes or refrigerate up to 8 hours, allowing meat
to return to room temperature before cooking.
</p>
<p>
2.  Start fire in grill by placing drip pan in center and
surrounding it with coals (see note) after lighting
coals, place grill rack 6" above coals.
</p>
<p>
3.  Place onions, one at a time, on cutting board, root
end down. Using sharp knife, cut into 8 wedges,
stopping two thirds of the way down to root end; do
not cut all the way through.  Place each onion, cut
side up, in center of 12" square of foil: top with
about 2 teaspoons apple jelly and 1 teaspoon
margarine.  Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon fresh thyme or
1/8 teaspoon dried and a pinch each salt and pepper.
Bring foil up around onions, crimping on top but
leaving 1" opening.
</p>
<p>

4.  When coals are white hot, set pork roast on hot grill
rack about drip pan, surround with onions.  Cook, with
grill covered, 1 hour 45 minutes until meat is cooked
through and instant-reading meat thermometer inserted
in center of roast registers 150; onions should be
tender.  Ten minutes before roast is done, brush with
some Kentucky Bourbon sauce to glaze.  Let roast stand
10 minutes before slicing.

5.  Cut pork into thin slices, serve garnished, if
desired, with thyme sprigs and accompanied by onions
and remaining sauce.  Makes 8 to 10 servings.
</p>
<p>
Note:  If desired, 1 1/2 to 2 cups favorite store bought
barbecue sauce, with 1/3 cup bourbon or orange juice
stirred in, may be substituted, simmer at least 15 minutes
after adding bourbon.
</p>
<p>
Pork loin and onions may also be cooked in oven.  Heat
oven to 350.  Place roast, seasoned as directed and fat
side up, on rack in shallow roasting pan, surround with
onions.  Insert oven thermometer into center of roast;
roast, uncovered, about 1 hour 20 minutes. Glaze roast and
serve as directed.
