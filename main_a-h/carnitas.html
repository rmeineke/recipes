1 cup (4 ounces) shredded Jack cheese 
       </li>

Beans: 
 </li>
 <li>
3/4 cup diced green chiles 
     </li>
     <li>
2 - 15  ounce cans Cannellini (white kidney) beans 
          </li>
          <li>
1 large onion
</li>

<h2>Directions</h2>

<p>


Cut turkey into 1 1/2 inch pieces and place in a 2-3 quart pan.  Cook,
covered, on medium heat to draw out juices, 8-10 minutes.  Uncover, cook on
high heat, stirring often, until liquid has evaporated and meat is well
browned, 10-12 minutes.  Add broth, garlic, bay leaf and oregano, stir to
scrape browned bits free from pan.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover
and simmer until meat is very tender when pierced, about 1 hour.  Uncover,
boil on high heat until all liquid has evaporated, 5-10 minutes.  Add
chilies and vinegar; stir to scrape browned bits free. Remove from heat.
Shred meat, using 2 forks or let cool and use your fingers.
</p>
<p>
Spread beans into a 10" round on a large ovenproof platter.  Top evenly with
shredded turkey.  If made ahead, cover and chill up until next day.  Bake,
covered, in a 400 oven until hot in the center, 15-25 minutes.  Uncover and
sprinkle with cheese. Bake, uncovered, until cheese melts, about 5 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Remove from oven.  Tuck 1/3 of the tortilla chips around edges.  Accompany
with remaining chips and pico de gallo.  Scoop layered mixture onto chips to
eat.

canned diced green chilies and 2 cans cannellini  (white kidney)
beans,drained.  Stir often, using back of spoon or potato masher to coarsely
mash beans, until mixture thickens slightly, about 5 minutes.
