<h1>
Grilled Chicken Breasts Stuffed w/ Ham &amp; Saga Blue
</h1>






<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>

1 whole boneless chicken breast with skin (about 1 pound) 
          </li>
          <li>
2 sticks of Saga Blue (each 2 x 1/2 x 1/2) 
           </li>
           <li>
2 thin slices of cooked ham (each 4 x 4) 
          </li>
          <li>
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 
    </li>
    <li>
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 
     </li>
     <li>
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<p>
Insert a sharp paring knife into the thicker end of each
chicken breast half and cut a lengthwise pocket carefully,
making it as wide as possible without puncturing the
sides.  Wrap each stick of Saga Blue in a ham slice,
enclosing it, insert the packages in the chicken pockets,
and seal each opening well with a wooden pick.  In a small
saucepan, bring the Worcestershire sauce and the lemon
juice just to a simmer, remove the pan from the heat and
swirl in the butter.  Grill the chicken, seasons with salt
and pepper on an oiled rack set about
6" over glowing coals, basting it frequently with the
sauce, for about 12 minutes on each side. (Do not baste
the chicken during the last 2 minutes of grilling and
discard any unused sauce.  (Serves 2)
