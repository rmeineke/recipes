<h1>
Grilled Pepper, Basil and Turkey Roulade with Basil Sour Cream Sauce
</h1>


<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>

4 medium red bell peppers 
     </li>
     <li>
1 large lemon  
   </li>
   <li>
1 cup sour cream 
    </li>
    <li>
1/3 cup chopped fresh basil leaves plus 2 cups large leaves 
           </li>
           <li>
1 (2 lb) boneless turkey breast half
</li>
</ul>




<h2>Directions</h2>

<p>
<span class="bold">
Roast Peppers:</span>
Roast peppers on racks of gas burners over high heat, turning with
tongs, until skins are blackened, 5 to 8 minutes.  Transfer to a bowl and
let stand, covered, until cool enough to handle.  Peel peppers and
discard stems and seeds.  Finely chop peppers and pat dry, then season
with salt and pepper.
</p>
<p><span class="bold">
Make sauce while peppers are standing:</span>
Finely grate 2 tsp zest from lemon and squeeze 2 tsp juice. Puree zest, juice,
sour cream and 1/3 cup chopped basil in a food processor until smooth and
season with salt and pepper.  Transfer to a bowl and chill, covered, while
preparing roulades.
</p>
<p><span class="bold">
Butterfly turkey:</span>
Remove skin and tender from turkey breast. Cut turkey breast in half
crosswise and chill 1 piece, covered, while working with the other.
</p>
<p>
Holding a sharp knife parallel to work surface and beginning on a long side, butterfly
turkey by cutting horizontally almost in half, then open it like a book.
</p>
<p>
Place between two sheets of plastic wrap and, with flat side of a meat
pounder or with a rolling pin, pound turkey to slightly less than 1/4-inch
thick.  Butterfly and pound remaining piece.
</p>
<p><span class="bold">
Make roulades:</span>
Season turkey pieces well with salt and pepper and divide roasted peppers
between them, spreading evenly and leaving a 1/4-inch border around edges.
Top peppers with whole basil leaves. Beginning with a short side, roll up
each turkey piece, gently pressing on filling while rolling (don't roll too
tight or filling will slip out of the ends), and tie roulades crosswise
with string.  Season roulades with salt and pepper.
</p>
<p>
Prepare grill for indirect grilling.  Place roulades on lightly oiled
rack and grill over coals turning occasionally to sear all sides.  Then
move to indirect heat and grill, covered with lid, turning roulades occasionally,
until meat is 170-gegrees internal, 15 to 20 minutes.  Transfer to
cutting board and let stand 10 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Discard string and slice roulades into 1/2-inch thick slices.  Serve
warm with sauce.
