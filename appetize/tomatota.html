<B>Tomato Tart</B><BR>
<BR>
2 or 3 medium thinly sliced red or yellow tomatoes or both (about 3/4 lb)<BR>
1 refrigerated pie crust from a 15 ounce package <BR>
1 egg white<BR>
2 tablespoons or more of store bought pesto <BR>
3 ounces or more of crumbled feta cheese<BR>
salt and pepper to taste<BR>
<BR>
Heat oven to 400 degrees. Place tomato slices on paper towels and thoroughly 
drain (appx 15 minutes on one side and 4 minutes more on the other).  Press 
crust into bottom of 10 inch tart pan with removable bottom (***I just used a pie 
pan).  Prick bottom of crust with fork; line shell with foil.  Fill with pie weights or 
any dried beans (to hold down the crust.  Bake 14 minutes.  Remove from oven; 
remove weights and foil.  Brush crust with egg white.  Bake 5 more minutes.  
Cool pan on rack.<BR>
<BR>
Spread pesto over crust; sprinkle with cheese.  Arrange drained tomatoes, 
slightly overlapping in concentric circles. *****I add cut up marinated artichoke 
hearts on top. (optional)  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Bake 25-30 minutes or 
until tomatoes are soft and crust is golden.  Cool on rack 10 minutes and 
remove pan sides if you used a tart pan.<BR>
