<BR>
Ready in 45 minutes or less<BR>
<BR>
1 tube (8 ounces) refrigerated Crescent rolls<BR>
3 medium zucchini, thinly sliced<BR>
1 garlic clove, minced<BR>
2tablespoons butter<BR>
2 teaspoons minced fresh parsley<BR>
1 teaspoon snipped fresh dill ( I use a bit more because I love dill)<BR>
1/4 teaspoon salt<BR>
1/4 teaspoon pepper<BR>
1 cup (4 ounces) shredded Monterey Jack cheese, <I>divided</I><BR>
2 eggs, lightly beaten<BR>
<BR>
Separate Crescent dough into eight triangles; place in a greased 9 inch pie plate with 
points toward the center.  Press onto the bottom and up the sides of the plate to form a 
crust; seal perforations.<BR>
<BR>
In a skillet, saute zucchini and garlic in butter.  Add the parsley, dill, salt, pepper and 1/4 
cup cheese.  Spoon into the crust.  Pour eggs over top; sprinkle with remaining cheese.  
Cover edges loosely with foil.  Bake at 375 for 25-30 minutes or until a knife inserted near 
the  center comes out clean.  Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.  Yield: 6 servings.<BR>
