<h1>Zucchini Timbales</h1>
<p>
Prep &amp; cook time: 1 hour.  If making up to 1 day ahead, prepare through step 5; 
cover and chill.  Let warm to room temperature and unmold.
<p>
<p>
**6-8 ramekins 1/2 - 3/4 cup size (I used Pyrex)
</p>
<ul><li>
About 1 1/2 ounces crusty Italian or French bread</li><li>
3 pounds zucchini</li><li>
1/4 to 1/2 cup olive oil</li><li>
3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced</li><li>
1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh or 1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano leaves.</li><li>
salt and pepper to taste</li><li>
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese (about 6 ounces)</li><li>
4 firm ripe tomatoes</li>

</ul>
<p>
1.  Cut bread into 1/2 inch chunks.  In a food processor or blender, whirl into 
coarse crumbs; you should have about 2/3 cup.
</p><p>

2.  Rinse zucchini and trim and discard ends.  Cut into 1/8 inch thick rounds.
</p><p>
3.  In a large (5-6 qt) saute pan over medium heat, stir bread crumbs often until 
golden and crisp, about 5 minutes.  Pour into bowl.
</p><p>
4.  Add 3 tablespoons olive oil to pan and increase heat to medium-high.  stir in 
zucchini, garlic, chopped oregano, salt and pepper.  Cover and cook, stirring 
occasionally, until zucchini begins to soften, about  5 minutes.  Uncover and stir 
often until zucchini is browned and soft when pressed, 7-10 minutes longer.  
Remove from heat and stir in toasted crumbs, the parmesan cheese and more 
salt and pepper if needed.
</p><p>
5.  Generously oil 6-8 ramekins with olive oil.  Divide zucchini mixture evenly 
among ramekins and press in firmly.  Let stand at room temperature at least 5 
minutes, up to four hours.

</p><p>
6.  Rinse and core tomatoes.  Cut crosswise into 1/4 inch slices.  Arrange 3 
tomato slices on salad plate.  Run a knife around the inside edge of ramekins 
and invert zucchini timbales onto tomatoes; if necessary, hold each ramekin and 
plate together and shake gently to release.  If desired, garnish with oregano 
sprigs.  You may drizzle some olive oil over the tomatoes if desired and salt and 
pepper those to taste also.
