     Rinse turkey and pat dry.  Place breast half, skinned side down
     between sheets of plastic wrap; with flat mallet, gently pound to an 
     even 3/8-inch thick. Peel off the top sheet of plastic wrap.
<BR><BR>
     Sprinkle fontina and parmesan cheese evenly over pounded turkey
     breast to within 1 1/2 inches of edges.  Scatter sage evenly over
     cheese.  Fold narrow ends of turkey over cheese mixture, then
     from one long side, gently roll turkey, peeling the bottom sheet
     of plastic wrap away as you go, to enclose filling and form a
     log about 3 inches wide and 12 inches long.  Brush all over
     with garlic oil.
<BR><BR>
     Wrap prosciutto slices crosswise around turkey, overlapping to
     cover log completely, including ends.  Tie roast with cotton string
     at 2-inch intervals.
<BR><BR>
     Prepare barbecue for indirect heat.  Cook roast until thermometer
     inserted in center of meat reaches 160 degrees, 20 to 25 minutes.
<BR><BR>
     Transfer roast to platter and, keeping it warm, let rest 5 to 10 
     minutes.  Garnish with sage sprigs.  Cut roast crosswise into 
     1/2-inch thick slices to serve.  Add salt to taste.
