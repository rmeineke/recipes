     </li>
     <li>
2 slices bread, chopped into fine crumbs 
       </li>
       <li>
3/4 cup chicken stock 
    </li>
    <li>
3/4 cup white wine or vermouth 
      </li>
      <li>
2 eggs 
  </li>
  <li>
1/2 cup milk 
   </li>
   <li>
3 beef buillon cubes 
    </li>
    <li>
Salt and pepper 
   </li>
   <li>
Allspice 
 </li>
 <li>
Sage or thyme 
   </li>
   <li>
Olive oil 
  </li>
  <li>
Several tablespoons of butter 
    </li>
    <li>
Corn starch and water
</li>
</ul>



<h2>Directions</h2>

<p>
1.  Trim all fat and excess scraps from the pork loins.  Save trimmings.
</p>
<p>
2.  Mix tablespoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon ground Allspice and 1/2 teaspoon sage or thyme.  Sprinkle both sides of pork loins with spices and let sit, refrigerated, for several hours.
</p>
<p>
3.  Cook onion in tablespoon olive oil and tablespoon butter.
</p>
<p>
4.  Thoroughly grind pork trimmings. Combine with onion in pan.  Add 1/4 cup wine, teaspoon Allspice and salt and pepper to taste.  Cook in pan until pork is completely cooked.
</p>
<p>
5.  Add spinach and 1/4 cup chicken stock.  Cover and cook for 3-5 minutes.  Drain mixture and save liquid from pan.
</p>
<p>
6.  In mixer, combine ground park, break crumbs and one egg.  Mix thoroughly.
</p>
<p>
7.  Brown pork loins in tablespoon butter and tablespoon olive oil over very low heat.
</p>
<p>
8.  Braise loins in 1/4 cup chicken stock and 1/4 cup wine.  Cover and let simmer for 12-15 minutes.  Drain, save liquid with liquid from sausage. Set loins aside.
</p>
<p>
**  Prepare dough. If using Pillsbury Hot Roll mix, prepare dough according to package directions (use the pizza dough recipe).  Divide dough into halves. Then divide one half into quarters.  Save the second half and bake with the wellingtons.
</p>
<p>
9.  Roll 4 dough patties (or the 4 Pillsbury dough balls) out thinly. Should be about 8" in diameter.  Place equal amounts of sausage mixture onto the center of each rolled out dough patty and spread evenly.  Place
pork loin on top of sausage, one loin per dough patty.
</p>
<p>
10. Bring edges of dough together and pinch shut, entirely encasing the pork loin and sausage mixture.  The area that is pinched together will become the bottom of the wellington.
</p>
<p>
11. Mix one egg with 1/2 cup milk.  Dip each wellington in the egg wash and place on cookie sheet, smooth side up, pinched side down.
</p>
<p>
12. Bake at 400&deg; for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.
</p>

</p>
<p>
14.  Serve wellingtons with gravy drizzled lightly over the top.
