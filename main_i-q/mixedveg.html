<h2>Directions</h2>

<p>
Prepare Roasted Garlic, set aside.  Prepare lentil
puree, set aside.
</p>
<p>
In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over low
heat.  Add carrot,squash, zucchini and leek; cook 7
minutes or until vegetables are tender.
</p>
<p>
In large bowl, mix together sauteed vegetables, grated
potatoes, lentil puree, thyme, 3/4 teaspoon salt,  and
the pepper until well blended.
</p>
<p>
Heat oven to 200&deg;.  In 6" skillet, heat 1/4 inch oil
over medium heat.  Drop 1 heaping cup of vegetable-
potato mixture into oil and flatten with a slotted
pancake turner or spatula to make rosti.
</p>
<p>
Cook rosti until golden - about 10 minutes on one
side.  Cover skillet with inverted plate; invert
rosti onto plate and slide back into skillet. Cook
other side until crisp and golden - about 10 more
minutes.  Transfer rosti to wire rack on baking
sheet; keep warm in oven while preparing remaining
three rostis.
</p>
<p>
While rostis are cooking, prepare Carrot sauce:
keep sauce warm over low heat.  While last rosti is
frying, in large skillet, heat about 1 teaspoon oil
over medium heat.  Add spinach and cook just until
wilted - about 2 minutes.  Toss with remaining 1/4
teaspoon salt.
</p>
<p>
To serve, pour about 1/4 cup carrot sauce onto each
plate;  place a rosti on top.  Divide spinach and
remaining roasted garlic cloves even among rostis.
</p>

Roasted Garlic:</span>  Heat oven to 375. With sharp knife, cut
off tops of 2 large heads garlic. Peel some of loose outer
skins from garlic.  Place garlic heads on small baking
sheet and brush with about 2 teaspoons olive oil.  Bake
garlic 35-40 minute or until very tender.  When cool
enough to handle, break cloves from heads of garlic and
squeeze from skin.  With fork or back of spoon, mash
enough cloves to make 1/4 cup; set aside for use in carrot
sauce.  Set aside remaining roasted garlic cloves for
garnish.
</p>
<p><span class="bold">
Lentil Puree:</span>  In medium size skillet, heat 1 teaspoon
olive oil;  add 1/2 cup finely chopped onion and saute
until tender.  Add 1/4 cup red lentils, 1 bay leaf and 1
cup water.  Cover and cook 20 minutes or until lentils are
soft.  Remove bay leaf and drain.  Mash lentils to make
thick puree.  Set aside to cool.
</p>
<p><span class="bold">
Carrot Sauce:</span>  In 2 quart saucepan, heat 2 cups carrot
juice over medium heat to boiling.  Cook until reduced by
half - about 25 minutes.  Add 1/4 cup mashed garlic (from
roasted garlic), 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, and 1
tablespoon olive oil.  In food processor fitted with
chopping blade or blender at high speed, process or blend
carrot mixture until well mixed.  Strain mixture,
reserving sauce only, in saucepan;  keep warm.
