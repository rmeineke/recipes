Poblano Chile Sauce
</h1>



<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>
3/4 pound fresh poblano chiles (also called pacina chiles)
 or yellow bell peppers</li>
<li>
2 garlic cloves</li>
<li>
1 large onion</li>
<li>
2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
<li>
1 cup chicken broth
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<p>
Lay whole peppers on their sides on racks of gas stove
burners (preferably 1 to a burner) and turn flame on
high.  Roast peppers, turning them, until skins are
blistered and have brown patches, 3-6 minutes.  Do
not overchar peppers, they will lose their bright color.
(Alternatively, peppers may be roasted in same manner
on rack of a broiler pan under a preheated broiler
about 2" from heat).  Transfer peppers to a bowl and
let stand, covered, until cool enough to handle.  Peel
peppers (wear rubber gloves when handling chiles) Cut
off tops and discard seeds and ribs.  Chop peppers.
(Peppers may be prepared one day ahead and chilled
covered.)
</p>
<p>
Chop garlic and chop enough onion to measure 1 cup.
In a nonstick skillet cook garlic and onion in oil
over moderately low heat, stirring, until sofened.
Skim fat from broth.  Stir in broth and peppers and
simmer 1 minute.  In a blender, puree mixture until
completely smooth (use caution when blending hot liquids)
and season with salt.

Makes 2 cups.
